# Real-time Transcription

This is a simple Python script that uses Streamlit and SpeechRecognition libraries to transcribe audio in real-time. The script captures audio from the microphone and utilizes Google's speech recognition service to convert the spoken words into text.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or above
- Install the required packages by running: `pip install streamlit speech_recognition`

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the script file.

2. Install the required packages if you haven't already.

3. Run the script by executing: `streamlit run app.py`

4. Once the Streamlit app launches in your browser, you will see two buttons: "Start" and "Stop".

5. Click the "Start" button to begin the real-time transcription. You should grant microphone access if prompted by your browser.

6. Start speaking, and the script will transcribe your speech in real-time and display the text on the web page.

7. If the script fails to understand the audio or encounters any errors, appropriate messages will be displayed.

8. To stop the transcription, click the "Stop" button.
